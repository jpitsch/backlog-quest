## Description

The best way to journey through your gaming backlog.

Here are some of the goals that I would like to accomplish as I continue to work on this project:
- Integration with a gaming database to pull in stock photos and information on the games.
- Integration with Howlongtobeat in order to see how long each game could potentially take.
- User ability to create a backlog based off of games they own.
- Ability to create a schedule based off of how much time you have each day/week/month in order to try and get through the backlog.
- Random game chooser which you can use filters to specify what you are in the mood to play.
- Schedule of all the upcoming games you have planned.
